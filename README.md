 # Immigrants and Exiles: Course Syllabus  

Syllabus for the course "ANSO 357: Immigrants and Exiles" (Department  of Anthropology and Sociology, Kalamazoo College, Spring Quarter 2019)

### Course description

From its classical reference to displaced communities as a result of wars of conquests or natural disasters to current movements of population across borders as a result of global capitalism, the concept of diaspora has accumulated an archive of academic and imaginative literature. This course, a comparative introduction to the study of diaspora, focuses on the development of diverse diasporic communities and their role on the current global stage. Our specific focus will be on how members of these communities stake their claims both to their home countries and to the countries in which they reside.
