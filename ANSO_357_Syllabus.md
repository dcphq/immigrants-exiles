### Course description

From its classical reference to displaced communities as a result of wars of conquests or natural disasters to current movements of population across borders as a result of global capitalism, the concept of diaspora has accumulated an archive of academic and imaginative literature. This course, a comparative introduction to the study of diaspora, focuses on the development of diverse diasporic communities and their role on the current global stage. Our specific focus will be on how members of these communities stake their claims both to their home countries and to the countries in which they reside.



### Course goals

Students will familiarize themselves with the complex, critical issues related to forced migration and reach a deeper understanding through a comparative, transnational and historical perspective. This is a writing intensive course aiming to help students improve their writing skills but also think, in self-reflexive ways, about different, multi-modal ways of story-telling through their engagement with ethnographic work, films and video, and digital storytelling media. 



### Course Materials

- De León, Jason. 2015. *Land of Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail.* University of California Press (Recommended)
- All weekly readings and class materials discussed in class.
- All articles, book sections, class presentations, discussion board posts, videos and media links uploaded on Moodle.

### Course policies

#### Staying up-to-date 

- Check your email and Moodle regularly for class announcements or schedule changes.  
- Keep up with the class schedule and the class syllabus.
- This syllabus, along with course assignments and due dates, is subject to change. It is the student’s responsibility to check for corrections or updates to the syllabus online. Any changes will be clearly noted on Moodle.

#### Communication

- Use your K college email account, not personal accounts.
- Email me if you need help or have questions about the class.

#### Participation and Discussion

This class welcomes contributions from everyone and promotes discussion, exchange of ideas, and collaboration. You are therefore expected to: 

- Keep an open mind for different views, be attentive to all contributions in online discussions and contribute with your own views and ideas. Offensive language or personal insults will not be acceptable. The class is based on dialogue and collaboration in ways that make everyone feel safe, welcome, and respected (* *also see following note on sensitive content*) Be ready to exchange ideas and contribute your own arguments and perspectives in collaborative, team work.
- Post regularly on the class blog following the class schedule and contribute to class discussions as structured by topic or question. Your grade will be calculated on post/no-post basis based on your participation throughout the term. Individual posts will not be evaluated. Posting in response to all prompts guarantees a 100% score.
- Make sure you are familiar with the readings and other class materials as assigned by topic on a weekly basis. 

<u>Note on sensitive content:</u> 
In this course we will often use materials and discuss events and aspects that refer to war and conflict, migrant deaths, gender/sexual violence and other forms of abuse or traumatic experiences. Some materials (readings, films, videos) may contain graphic descriptions and may be emotionally challenging for you. There will be no academic penalty, whatsoever, in case you need to leave the class. I will be always available to discuss any concerns you may have about class materials and figure out alternative ways to engage with the content or other available resources that will help you deliver assigned work. 

#### Absence policy

Only **three unexcused absences** are
allowed without penalty (for any additional absences you need to provide appropriate documentation); two tardies will count as one absence. Your overall grade will be lowered one full letter grade with each additional absence. **Missing five or more course meetings will result in an automatic failing
grade.**



#### Preparing and submitting writing assignments

- This is a writing intensive class that requires both reading and writing on a regular basis and often at a fast pace. Do not wait until the last moment to work on class readings and materials. Class material is grouped by topic in a way that encourages discussion across different media and sources (e.g. academic papers, documentaries, blog posts, online resources). You will need time to familiarize yourselves with this material in order to be able to draw links and connections and contribute with you own arguments and reactions to class discussions.
- Submit all assigned work on time. All papers must be submitted as email attachments (please use the pdf file format) on the due date by 11 pm. **A deduction of a grade per day for every day up to a week will be applied to late papers.** No papers will be accepted after that. 
- All papers must be in 12-point
  Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri font, double-spaced with 1-inch margins and pages numbered. Save your paper as a pdf file.
- Submit your own original work.  Plagiarism = failing grade. Consult K College's rules and policies about academic dishonesty: https://reason.kzoo.edu/studev/policies/dishonest/
- Use quotation marks and proper bibliographic references when citing the work of others.  Go to <http://www.aaanet.org/publications/style_guide.pdf> and download the Style Guide of the American Anthropological Association (hereafter AAA Style Guide). 



#### **Using citations**

Use quotation marks and proper bibliographic references when citing the work of others.  Go to <http://www.aaanet.org/publications/style_guide.pdf> and download the Style Guide of the American Anthropological Association (hereafter AAA Style Guide).  You can also find the PDF of the AAA Guide on Google.  All submitted work should follow this style guide.



#### Accessibility and Accommodations

If you anticipate or experience any sort of physical or academic barriers based on disability, or if there is any course content or material that is not fully accessible to you, feel free to let me know so that we can discuss options and make adjustments, as needed. K College has a set of policies, resources and procedures to meet the needs of students with disabilities (https://reason.kzoo.edu/studev/disabilities/) and will be available to find solutions and to help identify accessible resources and class materials.



### Evaluation and Grading

#### Evaluation:

- **Attendance and participation:** you are expected to participate in class discussions and activities on a regular basis any way you feel most comfortable with (real-time in-class discussions, group work, written questions and feedback). 
- **Blog posts:** we will be using the class blog for weekly discussions. You are expected to post a short (2-3 paragraphs or 250-300 words) response (by directly responding to the question, or replying to other student posts) on a weekly basis. Your post will be in response to a  prompt related to a class reading or material  according to the topics defined in the class schedule. The blog posts should include references and short quotations from class 
  readings and materials.  You are expected to critically reflect on class readings, discussions and materials and make connections to key concepts,
  other readings, and resources.
  Posts will be evaluated on a “posted/not-posted” basis. The grade will be calculated based on overall activity. For example, if you have a post for every single prompt/question, your score will be 100.  All weekly blog posts need to be on Moodle on the due date by 11 pm. **A deduction of a grade per day for every day up to a week will be applied to late blog posts.** Blog posts over a week late will not be accepted.
- **Response papers:** response papers are meant to provide a critical reflection on course readings and materials in response  to specific questions. Response papers should be 3-4 pages (700-1000 words, double space, Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri 12) long. There will be 4 response papers assigned in the quarter. **A deduction of a grade per day for every day up to a week will be applied to late papers.** No papers will be accepted after that.
- **Final paper:** in your final paper you are expected to engage deeper, and in a critical way with a certain aspect or issue (of you choice) we will be discussing in class. You will need to deliver an extensive text (8-10 pages) (2000 - 3000 words, double space, Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri 12) that will include references, and quotations from class readings and materials as well as from other sources. The final paper can be submitted in one of the following formats: 1) essay 2) extensive review of a reading or material 3) video, sound or mixed digital storytelling media with narrative or commentary of at least 2000 words.

#### Grading:

For grading purposes, coursework is distributed as follows:

- Attendance and participation: 20 %
- Blog posts: 20 %
- Response papers: 30 % (7.5% each)
- Final paper: 30 %

Your final grade will be based on the following grade rubric:
